# Introduction

This repo contains the Pytorch implementation of the MICCAI'20 paper - "Ultrasound Video Summarization using Deep Reinforcement Learning" [pdf](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09531v1).

![overview](figures/overview_ifind.png)

We introduce a novel fully automatic video summarization method that is tailored to the needs of medical video data. <br>
Our approach is framed as reinforcement learning problem and produces agents focusing on the preservation of important diagnostic information. <br>


# Setup

**Environment:** 
* PyTorch 0.4
* python 2.7
* numpy 1.15.1
* h5py 2.7.0
* matplotlib 2.0.2

**Pre-trained models:** 
The code utilize pre-trained sonoNet models for standard plane detection. More details for this model can be found here:<br>
The default path for pre-trained networks is [sononet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05601). <br>

**Dataset:**
The features extracted from the ultrasound videos can be downloaded [HERE](https://imperiallondon-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/trl15_ic_ac_uk/EoX1nQHhB3FJnbAzarOLwPgBbfU89iCXwnJaxg6rwteR_g?e=fcTrC3). 
The raw ultrasound dataset is not public subject to approval by the project ethics board and under a formal Data Sharing Agreement between the collaboration institutaions, the hospital and the participants.

# Demo Videos
Example video summaries from an untrasound examination:
1) reducing the video to 15% of itâ€™s original length: [demo1](https://youtu.be/K3kC2LEB0fY), 
2) unsupervised to 15% length: [demo2](https://youtu.be/72iP9F3XxMA) 
3) to a more relaxed 45% of the original length: [demo3](https://youtu.be/6LRs78hzRUs).
