# Demo Videos
An example video summary from an untrasound examination
1) reducing the video to 15% of itâ€™s original length: https://youtu.be/K3kC2LEB0fY, 
2) unsupervised to 15% length: https://youtu.be/72iP9F3XxMA 
3) to a more relaxed 45% of the original length here https://youtu.be/6LRs78hzRUs .
# Dataset
The features extracted from the ultrasound videos can be downloaded HERE. The raw ultrasound dataset is not public subject to approval by the project ethics board and under a formal Data Sharing Agreement between the collaboration institutaions, the hospital and the participants.
